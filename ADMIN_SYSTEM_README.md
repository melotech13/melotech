# Admin System Implementation

## Overview

The MeloTech system now includes a comprehensive role-based access control system with two distinct roles:

- **Users**: Regular farmers who can manage their farms, track crop growth, and use photo diagnosis
- **Admin**: System administrators who can manage all users, view system statistics, and oversee the entire platform

## Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Access Control

- **User Model Enhancement**: Added `role` field with enum values ('user', 'admin')
- **Admin Middleware**: Protects admin-only routes and functionality
- **Role Methods**: Added `isAdmin()` and `isUser()` helper methods to User model

### 2. Admin Account

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- Email: `admin@melotech.com`
- Password: `Admin@123`

**Important**: Change the password after first login for security!

### 3. Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides:
- System statistics overview
- Quick access to user management
- Recent user and farm activity
- Navigation to all admin functions

### 4. User Management

Admins can:
- View all users in the system
- Create new user accounts
- Edit existing user information
- Delete user accounts (with protection against self-deletion)
- View detailed user profiles with associated farms

### 5. System Statistics

Comprehensive statistics including:
- User counts (total, admins, regular users, new this month)
- Farm statistics (total, active, new this month)
- Photo analysis activity
- Progress update activity

### 6. Navigation Integration

- Admin navigation appears only for admin users
- Admin panel link in main navigation
- Admin-specific dropdown menu items
- Seamless integration with existing user interface

## Database Changes

### Migration: `add_role_to_users_table`

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role ENUM('user', 'admin') DEFAULT 'user' AFTER password;
```

### Seeder: `AdminUserSeeder`

Creates the default admin account with:
- Name: "System Administrator"
- Email: "admin@melotech.com"
- Password: "Admin@123" (hashed)
- Role: "admin"

## Routes

### Admin Routes (Protected by admin middleware)

```
/admin/dashboard          - Admin dashboard
/admin/statistics         - System statistics
/admin/users              - User management index
/admin/users/create       - Create new user form
/admin/users/{user}       - View user details
/admin/users/{user}/edit  - Edit user form
/admin/farms              - Farm management index
/admin/farms/{farm}       - View farm details
```

## Security Features

1. **Middleware Protection**: All admin routes are protected by `AdminMiddleware`
2. **Role Validation**: Server-side validation ensures only admins can access admin functions
3. **Self-Protection**: Admins cannot delete their own accounts
4. **Default Role**: New registrations automatically get 'user' role
5. **Password Security**: Admin password is properly hashed

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

1. **Login**: Use the admin credentials to log in
2. **Access Admin Panel**: Click "Admin Panel" in the navigation or use the dropdown menu
3. **Manage Users**: Navigate to "Manage Users" to view and edit user accounts
4. **View Statistics**: Check "Statistics" for system overview
5. **Create Users**: Use "Create New User" to add new accounts

### For Regular Users

- Regular users will not see admin navigation or have access to admin functions
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Users can still register normally and will be assigned the 'user' role

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `database/migrations/2025_09_02_003323_add_role_to_users_table.php`
- `database/seeders/AdminUserSeeder.php`
- `app/Http/Middleware/AdminMiddleware.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/AdminController.php`
- `resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/users/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/statistics.blade.php`

### Modified Files
- `app/Models/User.php` - Added role field and methods
- `app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php` - Added default role assignment
- `routes/web.php` - Added admin routes
- `bootstrap/app.php` - Registered admin middleware
- `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` - Added admin navigation

## Setup Instructions

1. **Run Migration**: `php artisan migrate`
2. **Seed Admin User**: `php artisan db:seed --class=AdminUserSeeder`
3. **Login as Admin**: Use admin@melotech.com / Admin@123
4. **Change Password**: Update admin password for security

## Maintenance

### Adding New Admin Users

1. Use the admin panel to create new users
2. Set role to 'admin' during creation
3. Or modify existing users through the admin interface

### Updating Admin Permissions

To add new admin-only features:
1. Add routes to the admin middleware group in `routes/web.php`
2. Create corresponding controller methods
3. Add navigation links in the layout file
4. Test with both admin and regular user accounts

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Policy**: Implement strong password requirements
2. **Session Management**: Consider session timeout for admin accounts
3. **Audit Logging**: Consider adding activity logging for admin actions
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for admin login attempts
5. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Consider 2FA for admin accounts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- User activity logging
- Admin action audit trails
- Bulk user operations
- Advanced user search and filtering
- User export functionality
- System health monitoring
- Automated backup management
